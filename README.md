Useful Scripts for Visualisation in Unity

This repository contains a number of useful scripts that I started using and adapting for the purpose of creating 3D interactive visualisations as part of the EPSRC and Ordance Survey sponsored PhD in Near Real Time Urban Data Spaces at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL.

Many of these scripts were also used in my sessions teaching Unity to students on the CASA MRes in Advanced Spatial Analysis and Visualisation in preparation for their final group visualisation projects.

Scripts include:

**MouseOrbitImproved** - A camera controller enabling the user to rotate around a central pivot and zoom in and out.
